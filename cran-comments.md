## Changes from current CRAN release

* Improved handling of integer values in the choices sheet of form definitions.
* Clarified information in `scto_catalog()`.

## Additional information

The tests require login credentials for a SurveyCTO server, which is why they are skipped on CRAN. They pass locally, on R-hub, and on GitHub Actions.
