## Changes from current CRAN release

* Added fetching of previous form versions and their definitions.

## Additional information

The tests require login credentials for a SurveyCTO server, which is why they are skipped on CRAN. They pass locally, on GitHub Actions (using repository secrets), and on R-hub (using environmental variables).
